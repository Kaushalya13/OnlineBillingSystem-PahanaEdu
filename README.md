### üöÄ Project Overview

Pahana Edu is a reputed bookstore that previously relied on manual processes for managing customer details and billing. This led to operational inefficiencies, data inconsistencies, and human error. This project delivers a user-friendly, web-based application with a clean administrative interface to manage all core bookstore operations.

> **Objective:** To eliminate manual errors, increase operational efficiency by over 50%, centralize data management, and provide a secure, scalable platform for Pahana Edu's business operations.
>
> **Target Users:** System Admin/Users (bookstore staff).
>
> **Technologies:** Java EE, MySQL, Maven, JUnit, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Layered Architecture.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on a **Layered Architecture** to promote a clean separation of concerns, making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

* **Presentation Layer:** Java Servlets and JSPs handle user interface rendering and process all incoming HTTP requests.
* **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic. It coordinates calls to the DAO layer and enforces all business rules (e.g., validating data before saving).
* **DAO (Data Access Object) Layer:** This layer abstracts and encapsulates all access to the database. It provides a clean API to the service layer for data persistence.
* **Data Layer:** A MySQL database is used for reliable and efficient relational data storage.

### üöÄ Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* MySQL Server
* Apache Maven
* A Java EE compatible server (e.g., Apache Tomcat)
* Git

**Installation**
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/OnlineBillingSystem-PahanaEdu.git](https://github.com/your_username/OnlineBillingSystem-PahanaEdu.git)
    cd OnlineBillingSystem-PahanaEdu
    ```
2.  **Set Up MySQL:**
    * Create a database for the project.
    * Import the schema from the `.sql` file located in the project.
    * Update the `database.properties` file with your MySQL credentials (URL, username, password).

3.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * Deploy the generated `.war` file (from the `target/` directory) to your Apache Tomcat server.
    * Access the application via `http://localhost:8080/your-app-context`.

### üß™ Testing

The project was developed using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

* **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit tests for the DAO and Service layers.
* **Framework:** JUnit.
* **Execution:** Tests are run automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline. To run them locally:
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```
* **Test Reports:** JUnit test results are generated and can be found in the `target/surefire-reports/` directory.

### üîß CI/CD Pipeline

The project features a complete CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring code quality and stability.

**Branch Strategy:**
* `development`: For developing new features.
* `stage`: Staging environment for integrating and testing features.
* `release`: Pre-production environment for final validation before a release.
* `main`: Contains stable, production-ready code.

**Key Processes:**
* **Merge Validation:** Enforces strict pull request (PR) rules to maintain branch integrity (e.g., PRs to `main` must come from `release`).
* **Unit Testing:** Automatically runs all JUnit tests for the DAO and Service layers on every push and PR.
* **Building:** Compiles the source code and packages the application into a `.war` file using Maven.
* **Deployment:** (Simulated) Automates deployment to different environments based on the source branch.

This pipeline ensures that every change is automatically validated, leading to a more reliable and streamlined development workflow.

### üîí Security

The system was designed with a security-first approach to protect sensitive business and customer data.

* **Password Hashing:** User passwords are never stored in plaintext. They are salted and hashed using a strong algorithm, ensuring they are secure even if the database is compromised.
* **Security Filter Chain:** A Java EE servlet filter is implemented to intercept all incoming requests to secure areas of the application. It ensures that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive functionalities like user management and billing.
